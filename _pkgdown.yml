- title: R6 classes
  desc: >
    The R6 classes are used as framework for reading, processing, inspecting
    and storing Mass Spectrometry (MS) and Spectroscopy data.
- contents:
  - MassSpecData
- title: S3 classes
  desc: >
    S3 classes are implemented to harmonize, verify and dispatch data within
    the R6 classes. _ProjectHeaders_ and _ProcessingSettings_ S3 classes are
    used in all R6 classes.

  - ProjectHeaders
  - ProcessingSettings

- title: Processing settings for MS data
  desc: >
    The _ProcessingSettings_ S3 class is used to store, assign and dispatch
    the algorithm and respective parameters to processing methods. The
    _ProcessingSettings_ object obtains a subclass according to the assinged
    algorithm for each MS processing method. Below the available subclasses
    for _ProcessingSettings_ are listed for each processing method.
