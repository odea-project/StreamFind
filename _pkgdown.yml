- title: Introduction
  desc: >
    StreamFind is built with two main class systems: R6 and S3. The R6 system is used for data processing engine classes, which are used for project managing. The S3 system is used for classes to manage metadata, analyses, data processing, results, audit trail and configuration. Below all classes exposed to the user are listed.
- title: Engines (R6)
  contents:
  - Engine
  - MassSpecEngine
  - RamanEngine
  - StatisticEngine
- title: Metadata (S3)
  desc: >
    Metadata classes are used to manage metadata (e.g., date, author and description) of main classes, such as the R6 engine classes.

  - matches("Metadata")
- title: Analyses (S3)
  desc: >
    Analyses represent data (i.e., actual data or links to raw data files) and results. Analyses child classes are implemented for each type of data.

  - matches("Analyses")
- title: Data Processing (S3)
  desc: >
    Data processing is governed by the Workflow class which consists of a sequence of ProcessingStep class objects. Processing methods for a specific type of data are implemented as child classes of the ProcessingStep class.

  - Workflow
  - ProcessingStep

- title: Raman Spectroscopy Methods

- title: Statistic Methods
  contents:
  - starts_with("StatisticMethod_")
- title: Results (S3)
  desc: >
    The Results classes represent results of specific data processing methods. Results child classes are implemented for each processing method but can be reused/updated across processing methods. For instance, normalizing averaged spectra will update the spectra results. 
  contents:
  - matches("Results")
- title: Configuration (S3)
  desc: >
    Configuration is governed by Config class which consists of a list of ConfigParameter class objects. Childs of both Config and ConfigParameter classes are implemented for specific use cases.

  - matches("Config")
- title: Audit Trail (S3)
  desc: >
    Audit trail is governed by a specific classes, registering all changes made to the data within an engine.
  contents:
  - matches("AuditTrail")
- title: Other Functions
  contents:
  - convert_ms_files
  - trim_ms_files_spectra
  - run_app
- title: S7 Generics
  desc: >
    Severeal S7 generics are used to define a common interface for a set of related functions. The behavior and possible arguments vary depending on the class of the object passed.
