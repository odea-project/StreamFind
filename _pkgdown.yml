- title: Introduction
  desc: >
    StreamFind is built with two main class systems: R6 and S7. The R6 class system is used for engines, which are interfaces for reading, processing, and inspecting data. The S7 class system is used for all other objects.
- title: Engine Classes
  desc: >
    Engines are R6 classes and are interfaces for reading, processing and inspecting a defined type of data.

  - MassSpecEngine
  - RamanEngine

- title: Metadata Classes
  desc: >
    Metadata is governed by the Metadata S7 classes.

- title: Analyses Classes
  desc: >
    Analyses are S7 classes and represent data and results in StreamFind. Analyses child classes are implemented for each type of data.

- title: Data Processing Classes
  desc: >
    Data processing is governed by the Workflow S7 class which consists of a sequence of ProcessingStep S7 class objects. Processing methods for a specific type of data are implemented as child classes of the ProcessingStep class.

- title: S7 generics
  desc: >
    Generics are S7 and S3 methods that are used to define a common interface for a set of related functions. The behavior and possible arguments vary depending on the class of the object passed.
