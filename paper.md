# Summary

The StreamFind project, entitled “Flexible data analysis and workflow
designer to identify chemicals in the water cycle”, is funded by the
[Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung
(BMBF)](https://www.bmbf.de) and is a cooperation between the [Institut
für Umwelt & Energie, Technik & Analytik e. V.
(IUTA)](https://www.iuta.de), the [Forschungszentrum Informatik
(FZI)](https://www.fzi.de/) and supporting partners. 

The goal of the
StreamFind project is the development and assembly of data processing
workflows for mass spectrometry and spectroscopy and the application of
the workflows in environmental and quality studies of the water cycle.
The StreamFind aims to stimulate the use of advanced data analysis
(e.g., non-target screening, statistical analysis, etc.) in routine
studies, promoting standardization of data processing and structure and
easing the retrospective evaluation of data. The StreamFind platform is
directed to academics but also technicians, due to the aspired
comprehensive documentation, well categorized set of integrated modular
functions and the graphical user interface.  

# Statement of need
<!-- TODO: >

# Mathematics
<!-- 
Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text. -->

# Citations
<!-- 
Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)" -->

# Figures
<!-- 
Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% } -->
