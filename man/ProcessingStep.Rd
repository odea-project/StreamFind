\description{
The \code{ProcessingStep} class is used to define a processing step within a
\link{Workflow}. It contains information about the data type, method, algorithm,
parameters, and other relevant metadata for the processing step. The \code{ProcessingStep} is the
parent class of all processing methods in StreamFind.
